# === Puma control rack application ===

# Start the puma control rack application on "url". This application can
# be communicated with to control the main server. Additionally, you can
# provide an authentication token, so all requests to the control server
# will need to include that token as a query parameter. This allows for
# simple authentication.
#
# Check out https://github.com/puma/puma/blob/master/lib/puma/app/status.rb
# to see what the app has available.

# If you are preloading your application and using Active Record, it's

# The code in the `on_worker_boot` will be called if you are using
# clustered mode by specifying a number of `workers`. After each worker
# process is booted, this block will be run. If you are using the `preload_app!`
# option, you will want to use this block to reconnect to any threads
# or connections that may have been created at application boot, as Ruby
# cannot share connections between processes.

# this be combined with "pidfile" and "stdout_redirect".
